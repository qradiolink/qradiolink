Description: Multimode SDR transceiver for GNU radio
 QRadioLink is a GNU/Linux software defined radio VOIP (radio over IP)
 transceiver application using Internet for communication, built on
 top of GNU radio, which allows experimenting with software defined
 radio hardware using different digital and analog radio signals and a
 Qt5 user interface.
 .
 Its primary purpose is educational, but it can also be customized for
 low power data communications on various ISM frequency bands. It can
 also be used as a low power amateur radio SDR transceiver for
 demonstrating radio communications to children at schools.
