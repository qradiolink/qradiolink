A tile-based "slippy map" library written in/for C++/Qt. BSD licensed (see LICENSE). It's meant to enable C++/Qt developers to easily add nice, interactive maps to their applications.

Its only dependency is Qt. If you're on a system with recent Qt libraries and a good C++ compiler, this should build.

If you're using QtCreator, just open the .pro file and build it. If you're on a command line, run qmake on the .pro file, then make.

If you're using Visual Studio or Eclipse or some other C++ IDE, google around for instructions on building Qt projects with your IDE.
